// Fail when a commit reached `main` without a pull request behind it.
//
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
// Branch protection is not enabled on this repo yet (#85), so for now
// nothing at GitHub's end stops a direct push to `main` or a merge taken with CI
// red. Two layers stand in for it, and both are preventive: `guard-merge.mjs`
// only loads in a Claude Code session that started with `.claude/settings.json`
// present, and `merge-pr.mjs` only binds whoever chooses to type it. A layer
// that can be bypassed cannot tell you it was bypassed.
//
// This one runs on the result, so it cannot be. For every commit a push added to
// `main` it asks the API which pull requests that commit belongs to. A squash
// merge from a PR is associated with it; a commit pushed straight to `main` is
// associated with nothing. That is the whole distinction, and it is the one we
// need. Recorded in docs/architecture/decisions/0001-pr-only-provenance.md.
//
// It detects rather than prevents: by the time it fails, the commit is on main.
// The value is that the failure is loud, dated and attributable, which is what
// makes "we enforce this procedurally" an auditable claim instead of a promise.
//
